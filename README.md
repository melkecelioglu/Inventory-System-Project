**** The technologies used in inventory management system project
• Java: All codes have been written using the java programming language. • MySql: MySql has used as a database for this project.
• Apache: This project has developed inside of the Apache.
The goals of providing this project:
• Check the product status
• Control the system ****


3. Things Done During the Project
First of all I draw an outline of the project. I’ve written the components I will be needded. I though a lot on how to make my project easy to use also effective.I started my project by designing the JFrames. After adding tables, labels, JTextFileds, and a lot more components. I made my project design as undecorated, I created my own closing option by clicking on an image. For Swing Components that does not exist on my Swing Control Panel, I added JAR libraries and import them (For instance jCalendar, GradientPanels also to Connect mysql connector).
After designing, I created MySQL database tables, variables and connected it to the project. Then I tried to SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT my datas. That part was a bit compelling for me, I often got SQL Syntax Error. Because of my Home panel has not changed, I just change the main part, I used InternalFrames. I also learned how to create my own jar library.
I wanted to change the password part as sending SMS, not e-mail. But I searched on the internet and the way of sending OTP Messages is to use textlocal.co.uk I am not located in UK right now, that is why I could not even Subscribe to the system. I Verified the new password by sending E-mails.




4. Annotations
Initially, I have learned thanks to this project. Inventory Managements system project strengthen my knowledge, pratic and speed on Java, Swing and GUI. I had a lot fun especially Coding on PingPong and Graphics part. I had struggled a lot on Database Connection, Inserting, Updating and adding part. I have realised that struggling, taking a lot of errors expands my knowledge and helps me to master the subject. I learned how to control MySQL workbench, experienced improving coding games, graphics, image silde shows and a lot more exciting Applications on Netbeans, Apache. This project expanded my horizon on coding in Java. I realised that I can do a lot things with Java!

* Whenever I had errors or stuck on my code, first of all I tried to detect the problem, I tried out to solve the problem on my own, if I could not solve it after approximately 20 minutes, I took a look at StackOverFlow, If I still could not solve the problem, then I got some help from YouTube.
** In my Point of View Java Tutorial is the best Tutorial for Java. I read it whenever I feel not ready to code a project or challenge on a subject.
*** At the beginning of the project, On the first two stage (Literature Review and Preliminary research process) I’ve searched for project that are online. I got some idea About the project thank to them.
